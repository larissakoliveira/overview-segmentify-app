# Performance Tips and Best Practices

## 1. Performance Optimizations

### Canvas Performance
- Implement canvas object caching for static elements (objectCaching) - polygon and image im doing already
- Use `fabric.js` object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (it can be reused and reset the initials configs to reuse as you want)
- Optimize the polygon drawing logic by implementing throttling for mouse events (Use lodash, the throttle function, which can be used to limit the rate at which a function is executed.)
- Consider using `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth canvas animations (ensure that the canvas is rendered smoothly, leveraging the browser's optimized rendering loop)

### React Optimizations
- Implement React.memo() for components that receive the same props frequently
- Use useMemo() for expensive calculations in the Canvas component
- Implement useCallback() for event handlers passed as props
- Add proper dependency arrays to useEffect hooks - Need to clean warnings
- Use React Suspense and Lazy for code-splitting

### State Management
- implement Redux for better state management

## 2. Code Structure Improvements

### Project Architecture
- Separate business logic from UI components
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all components

## 3. Best Practices

### TypeScript
- Use proper type annotations instead of 'any'
- Implement proper error handling with custom types
- Use discriminated unions for complex state management

### Testing
- Implement unit tests for utility functions (Jest maybe)
- Add integration tests for critical canvas operations (Jest maybe)
- Implement E2E tests (Cypress maybe)

### Code Quality
- Implement ESLint with strict rules
- Add Prettier for consistent code formatting
- Use Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries

## 4. CSS and Styling Improvements

### Styling Best Practices
- Implement CSS Modules or tailwind
- Implement proper CSS reset/normalize(ant design implemented)

### Performance
- Implement CSS containment where applicable (canvas maybe)
- Use will-change property judiciously (not for now)
- Implement proper CSS loading strategies (critical css, non-critical async, css minification, bundling, deferred)

## 5. Build and Deployment

### Optimization
- Implement proper code splitting (split big files)
- Enable tree shaking (dont use in this but check out more later)
- Optimize bundle size using webpack-bundle-analyzer (test later)
- Implement proper caching strategies (test CDN caching, HTTP Caching)

### CI/CD
- Implement automated testing in CI pipeline and add automated deployment process
- Add security scanning in the pipeline (test Snyk, Dependabot)

## 6. Monitoring and Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- Implement React Profiler (measure the performance the React components.)
- Add performance monitoring tools (Sentry in prod)
- Track Core Web Vitals (to improve user experience on the web)

### Analytics
- Track canvas usage patterns (understand how users are interacting with the canvas, identify common usage patterns, and optimize the user experience.) Google Analytics

## 7. Accessibility

### A11y Improvements
- Add proper ARIA labels
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add screen reader support
- Implement proper focus management
- Add proper color contrast

## 8. Security

### Security Best Practices
- Add Content Security Policy (Use tools like Helmet in Express to set CSP headers easily)
- Implement proper CORS policies (Cors middleware in Express to set CORS headers easily.)

## 9. Documentation

### Documentation Improvements
- Add proper JSDoc comments



## vscode
Performance: Use object caching, memoization, debouncing, lazy loading, and virtualization.

Code Quality: Enforce linting, formatting, and type checking. Write unit and integration tests.

Readability: Break down components, use custom hooks, and maintain a clear folder structure.

Best Practices: Manage state effectively, handle errors, and ensure proper cleanup.

Memoization: Use React.memo and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and values.

Debouncing and Throttling: Implement debouncing or throttling for event handlers that trigger frequently, such as resize or mouse move events.

Lazy Loading: Use React's React.lazy and Suspense to lazy load components that are not immediately needed.

Component Decomposition: Break down large components into smaller, reusable components to improve readability and maintainability.

Custom Hooks: Extract reusable logic into custom hooks to keep components clean and focused on rendering.
Best Practices

Testing: Write unit tests using Jest. Write integration tests to cover interactions between components.
